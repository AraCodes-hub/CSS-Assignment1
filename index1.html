         <h3> ELUE PRECIOUS IFEAKACHUKWU</h3>
         
<P>Why won't i love technology. I am a class representative in my department and i had to introduce few technologies to my lecturers and my fellow students for better learning experience. Imagine not having lectures in an overcrowded class because we now use Zoom video platform for our online classes. What about the use of Google to access numerous materials and textbooks. Also the use of Whatsapp and Telegram to pass information about classes. Google is literally my best friend because almost all my answers are at my finger tips. With just one tap, i have access to them. Also, i can now easily learn other foreign languages just from my phone without having to pay for any physical lectures. Technology also helps you organize your life and work better. Time is money, acesss to Modern tools and techniques. It also makes you smarter and it is fun.  </P>

<h3>WHAT I HAVE LEARNT SO FAR</h3>
<p> CSS makes the front end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. I learnt that without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate. In addition to layout and format, CSS is responsible for fonts, texts, colours, background, margins and layout.</p>

<h3> DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PADDING, MARGIN AND BORDER</h3>
<p> Padding- The inner space between the content and the border of your box. 
    <p>Border- The perimeter of the box. Border can be invisible or they could be a thick colored line.
   <p> Margin- The outer space(lack of space) surrounding the box.
